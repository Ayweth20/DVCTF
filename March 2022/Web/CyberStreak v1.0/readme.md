### CyberStreak v1.0
**Category:** Web - **Points:** 500 (at the beginning) then 367 (at the end) - **Difficulty:** Easy - **Solves:** 68  
**Description:**  
Hello,  
I am a student and I would like to improve my web development skills. To practice, I am creating my first web application. This application is a kind of cybercoach. Example: you want to do sports. A sport goal could be to do 100 push-ups per day for 1 month. The application will allow you to create this "challenge" and each day, you will have to do the number of push-ups you have set and note it in the application. If you don't do the push-ups for 3 days, it's a failure and you lose your streak.  

This first version of the application gives you the possibility to create an account and to do the challenge of the example.  

Can you test the security of my application ?
