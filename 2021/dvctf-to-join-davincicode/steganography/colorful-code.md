**Hints:** _What's that in the corners?_

**Solution:**\
To solve this challenge you need to decrypt the image.\
At looking the image, you can't find the FLAG because the image is so strange but you can see that is a special QR Code...\
So to decrypt the image there is a website who can display the content FLAG after transform the image : [JAB Code](https://jabcode.org/scan/)\
So when you upload the .jpeg file in the website the FLAG is displayed automitically.\
So after consult the website you know it's a JAB Code and not a QR Code...
