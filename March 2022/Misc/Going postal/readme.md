### ICMP
**Category:** OSINT & Steganography - **Points:** 500 (at the beginning) then 490 (at the end) - **Difficulty:** Easy - **Solves:** 20  
**Description:** My dear friend "Bob" made a tool online to uncover the truth behind that map.  

**Infos:**
> A .jpg file is provided (map.jpg)  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to analyse the jpg file in first step.  
So to analyse an image in OSINT, I recomand to use [Aperisolve](https://aperisolve.fr/). When we upload the file on the website, we can see there is a .7z file in backgroung data :

We download them but this .7z file is locked with password...
