**Infos:**

> A file without extension is provided (cracking)

**Solution:**\
To solve this challenge you need to do researches about the file.\
On Linux with the command `file cracking` you can find that is an ELF file.\
So after this discovery, you can orient your researches on this file type.\
After a few researches I found the [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) util. It is a very helpful program.\
So I opened my file with this program and I saw a main function. After examine these function I saw the characters of the FLAG.
