**Description:** I've always wanted to visit the statue of this fine gentleman but I don't know where it is, can you tell me what city it is in?

**Infos:**
> A .png file is provided (banana.png)

**Hint:** Flag format: DVC{Name_Of_City}

**Solution:**  
To solve this type of challenge you need to be veeerrryyy patient.  
For example here, we just have an image where we can see a chimpanzee whose legs are discarded.
He is elongated and we can see his genitals.

So with these details, we can do some other searches to find others information and eventually the response.  
After a looooot of searches, we can find that there is a statue in the same position in Prague :
