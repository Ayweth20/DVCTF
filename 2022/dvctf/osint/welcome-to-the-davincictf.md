To solve this challenge you need to analyse all details in the image.

We can see differents details : Post-It (x3), Seed Phrase Card, Websites...\
\-> **Post-It nÂ°1 (left) :** _Binance elonmusk78@gmail.com Password01_\
I try to connect on this Google account, but the password is incorrect. And searches infos [here](https://tools.epieos.com/?q=elonmusk78%40gmail.com). I didn't insist on this track.\

\-> **Post-It nÂ°3 (bottom right) :** _TODO : - Acheter du BTC - Acheter du DegenAPE - Devenir riche - PrÃ©parer la page d'accueil du CTF_\
Nothing is really usable here...\

I try to connect with the seed phrase on Binance, but she is incorrect. It's true that the image isn't very clear...\

I search all website but I don't find anything...\
After reviewing the image, I see that the dvCTF URL is strange : _https://ctfd.davincicode.fr/\__. So I go to the website and if you analyze the source code, you can see that the flag is on the bottom page, but the css color the text to white.\
